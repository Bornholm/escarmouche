# Game Rules

## Materials

- 1 game board 8Ã—8 squares (chessboard)
- Units, customizable figures or tokens (1 to 6 per player)
- Descriptive cards (1 per unit)
- Damage or status markers
- 1 die to determine the first player

## Squad Composition

Each player assembles their squad while respecting the following constraints:

- **1 to 6 units** maximum
- **30 rank points (RP)** cumulative maximum (see below)

Each unit has a rank, representing its overall power, identified on its descriptive card. The ranks are as follows:

- **Soldier**: 1 RP
- **Veteran**: 3 RP
- **Elite**: 6 RP
- **Champion**: 10 RP
- **Paragon**: 15 RP

A squad can thus be composed of:

- 2 Paragons;
- 2 Champions, 1 Elite, 1 Veteran and 1 Soldier;
- Etc

To facilitate the creation and composition of your squads, an application is available online, [**the Barracks**](https://bornholm.github.io/escarmouche/barracks/).

> The calculation of each unit's rank is based on a complex formula that allows balancing squads, regardless of the combinations used by the player.

## Unit Characteristics

Each unit also has 4 main characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Health**     | Maximum hit points (when reduced to 0, the unit is eliminated) |
| **Range**      | Maximum attack distance (in squares)                           |
| **Power**      | Damage dealt per attack                                        |
| **Movement**   | Number of squares traversable per movement action              |

_Note: Diagonal movements are allowed._

## Setup

1. Place the board between the two players
2. Each player positions their units on **their first two rows** (rows 1-2 for one player, rows 7-8 for the other)
3. Units can be placed freely on these starting rows
4. Roll a die to determine who goes first

## Turn Sequence

On their turn, the active player performs **exactly 2 actions** from:

### Available Actions

- **Movement**: Move a unit up to its Movement value
- **Attack**: Attack an enemy unit within range and line of sight
- **Ability**: Activate a special ability (if available)

### Action Rules

- The 2 actions can be performed by the **same unit** or **distributed** across 2 different units
- The same unit can perform multiple actions in the turn
- **Restriction**: A unit can only perform **1 attack per turn** or activate **1 ability per turn**

## Combat

### Attack

1. **Declaration**: Choose a target within range and line of sight
2. **Resolution**: The attack succeeds automatically (unless a contrary ability)
3. **Damage**: The target loses a number of Health points equal to the attacker's Power
4. **Elimination**: If Health drops to 0 or less, remove the unit from the board

### Line of Sight and Cover

- A unit can attack if an **uninterrupted straight line** can be drawn between it and its target
- This line can start from **any corner** of the attacker's square
- **Other units** (allied or enemy) block line of sight
- **Obstacle = Total cover** (attack impossible)

## Victory Conditions
